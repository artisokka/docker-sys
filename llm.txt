Using LLM to solve the exercise
- ChatGPT-4o

I asked ChatGPT to generate a file structure and pick two languages for the service to help me get 
started with the exercise and it provided me with this

/project
│
├── service1/
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── Dockerfile
│
├── service2/
│   ├── app.js
│   └── Dockerfile
│
└── docker-compose.yaml

However it forgot to include a package.json file in the initial draft which I had to add myself… A 
somewhat crucial mistake since my goal was to use AI to get a jumpstart at developing this *grin*

Next I gave it my first drafts of both services and asked it how to structure Dockerfiles for both 
services and while it gave me a correct Dockerfile for service2, it failed to write a functional 
Dockerfile for service1 due to an outdated base image I presume, resulting in the following output:

  "Service1": {
    "Disk Space": "Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\noverlay        1007G   30G  926G   4% /",
    "IP Address": "172.25.0.3",
    "Processes": "/bin/sh: 1: ps: not found",
    "Uptime": "/bin/sh: 1: uptime: not found"
  },

This is the faulty Dockerfile:

FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8199
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

However I managed to fix it by adding the following line, hopefully it doesn't result in unexpected behavior 
during testing:

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y procps

AI managed to help me get started in structuring the app but gave me some grief too.
