Containers share the host's OS, resulting in a much faster subsystem compared to for example virtual machines. The container also shares the host's networking system so that the container can access the same networking resources and ports. The container is basically a snapshot of the host from a specific time point that can be used to run a system in a secure and efficient sandbox.
